Here is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project which named "Vitordo". 

## The vita-ordo concept

“Vitordo” appears to have Latin roots, derived from Vita (meaning “life”) and a modified form of ordo (meaning “order” or “arrangement”). This suggests a concept of “life in order” or “structured life,” which aligns well with this app’s goal of promoting a more scheduled lifestyle and mental well-being.
